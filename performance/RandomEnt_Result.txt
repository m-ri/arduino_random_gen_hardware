Entropy = 1.000000 bits per bit.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 371834040 bit file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 371834040 samples is 28.13, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bits is 0.4999 (0.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.148325537 (error 0.21 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000895 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
